# Census-MDP
MDP-based approach to census worker allocation for more representative census results.

We have submitted our paper on this project which will be linked here after grading.

## Getting Started
Open the `Census-MDP.ipynb` file in a Julia-installed Jupyter environment and run the
cells to set up, run, solve, and visualize the Census MDP.

Try tuning the fixed visit cost, timestep resolution and population/demographic
weight parameters to change outcomes, and view the changes in the bar chart
GIF animations as well as the demographic comparison graph for the final outcomes.

## Credits
This project was a final project submission for Stanford's CS238 / AA228: Decision Making
Under Uncertainty in Autumn 2020, by Cem Gokmen, Lynn Dezhen Kong, and Connor Toups. See
the paper's contributions section for more details.
